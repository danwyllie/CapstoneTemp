Udacity Capstone Project

1.  Decided to create a Weather app, based on Python & Flask, which uses https://openweathermap.org/
    Based on the article: https://webdamn.com/develop-weather-app-using-flask-in-python/
2.  Created a virtual environment then setup the app to ensure it was functional on my local machine.
3.  Made changes and updates to the original code to improve it.
4.  Created a new GitHub repo ## NAME & URL TBC ## and created all the files required
5.  Created a Makefile and performed tests
6.  Created a Dockerfile and run_docker.sh file to test locally
